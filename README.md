Smart Contract: PojectExample

This smart contract performs the require(), assert(), and revert() statements to do various checks and calculations. It takes a value as input, performs some calculations, and returns the result.

Functions:
checkValue::

This function takes a uint256 value as an input parameter and returns a uint256 result. It performs the following steps:

1. Checks if the input value is greater than zero using the require() statement. If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction with an error message.

2. Initializes a uint256 variable called result.

3. Checks if the value is less than 100 using the assert() statement. If the condition does not follows, it reverts the transaction.

4. It Performs a calculation by multiplying the value by 2 and assigns the result to the result variable.

5. Checks if the result is greater than 200 using an if statement. If the condition is met, it reverts the transaction with an error message.

6. Returns the result variable.

Usage:

1. Deploy the smart contract to a compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

2. Call the checkValue() function, providing a positive non-zero value as the input.

3. The smart contract will validate the input using the require() statement. If the condition is met, it proceeds to the next steps.

4. The smart contract will validate the input using the assert() statement. If the condition is met, it proceeds to the next steps.

5. The smart contract will perform calculations by multiplying the input value by 2.

6. The smart contract will check if the result exceeds 200. If the condition is met, it reverts the transaction with an error message.

7. If all conditions are met, the smart contract returns the calculated result.

Error Handling:

This smart contract utilizes the following error handling mechanisms:

require(): It checks if the input value is greater than zero. If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction with an error message.

assert(): It checks if the input value is less than 100. If the condition is not met, it reverts the transaction without a specific error message.

revert(): It checks if the calculated result exceeds 200. If the condition is met, it reverts the transaction with an error message.

Please note that the revert() statement can also be used with custom error messages to provide more specific details about the error encountered.
